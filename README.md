## Admin Access

To access the main functionalities of the project, you need to log in as an admin. The admin account is seeded automatically during the migration process. Use the following default credentials to log in:

- **Username:** `admin@bookstore.com`
- **Password:** `Admin123*`

If you prefer creating your own admin account, follow these steps:
1. Run the application and create a new user.
2. Update the user in the database to have an admin role (you can use the SQL scripts provided in the `Database` folder).
